## 🚀 Getting Started (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Set Up Python Environment
```bash
# Navigate to your learning folder
cd /Users/godsonkurishinkal/_ACTIVE/Learning

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate it
source venv/bin/activate

# Install essential packages
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy jupyter
```

### Step 2: Start Jupyter
```bash
# From Learning folder
jupyter notebook
```

### Step 3: Open a Starter Notebook
- Navigate to any subject's `notebooks/` folder
- Open the starter notebook (e.g., `01-basics-practice.ipynb`)
- Start learning and coding!

## 📖 How to Use This System

### Daily Routine
1. **Morning**: Review previous day's notes (10 mins)
2. **Class Time**: Take notes in `/notes` folder
3. **Evening**: Practice in Jupyter notebooks (30-60 mins)
4. **Before Bed**: Update progress tracker (5 mins)

### Weekly Routine
- **Mon-Wed**: Lectures + Notes
- **Thu-Fri**: Practice + Assignments
- **Sat**: Extra practice + Projects
- **Sun**: Review + Plan next week

## 📁 Quick Navigation

### Where to Put What?

| Content Type | Location | Format |
|--------------|----------|--------|
| Lecture notes | `[Subject]/notes/` | Markdown (.md) |
| Code practice | `[Subject]/notebooks/` | Jupyter (.ipynb) |
| Assignments | `[Subject]/assignments/` | Folder with files |
| Extra problems | `[Subject]/practice/` | Any format |
| Resources | `[Subject]/resources/` | PDFs, links, etc. |

### File Naming
```
✅ Good:
- week-01-introduction.md
- 2025-11-14-calculus.md
- 01-basics-practice.ipynb
- assignment-01-solution.py

❌ Avoid:
- notes.md (too generic)
- stuff.ipynb (not descriptive)
- final_final_v2.py (confusing)
```

## 💡 Pro Tips for Foundation Level

### Mathematics
- Use Python to verify calculations
- Visualize every function you learn
- Practice 5-10 problems daily

### Statistics  
- Always visualize your data first
- Learn theory AND implementation
- Use real datasets for practice

### Python
- Code every single day (even 30 mins)
- Type code, don't copy-paste
- Build small projects weekly

### General
- **Space repetition** works better than cramming
- **Teach others** to solidify understanding
- **Ask questions** early and often
- **Stay consistent** over being perfect
