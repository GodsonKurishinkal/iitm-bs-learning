## 🚀 Getting Started (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Set Up Python Environment
```bash
# Navigate to your learning folder
cd /Users/godsonkurishinkal/_ACTIVE/Learning

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate it
source venv/bin/activate

# Install essential packages
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy jupyter
```

### Step 2: Start Jupyter
```bash
# From Learning folder
jupyter notebook
```

### Step 3: Open a Starter Notebook
- Navigate to any subject's `notebooks/` folder
- Open the starter notebook (e.g., `01-basics-practice.ipynb`)
- Start learning and coding!

## 📖 How to Use This System

### Clear Separation: Notes vs Notebooks

#### 📝 **Notes** = Theory & Study Content
- **Location**: `[Subject]/notes/`
- **Format**: Markdown (.md)
- **Contains**: Concepts, definitions, theorems, formulas, proofs
- **Purpose**: Understand the "what" and "why"
- **Example**: `notes/week-01-set-theory.md`

#### 💻 **Notebooks** = Examples & Applications
- **Location**: `[Subject]/notebooks/`
- **Format**: Jupyter (.ipynb)
- **Contains**: Code, implementations, visualizations, experiments
- **Purpose**: Practice the "how" through coding
- **Example**: `notebooks/week-01-set-operations.ipynb`

### Daily Routine

**Theory Phase** (30-60 mins):
1. **Read/Watch**: Lecture or textbook chapter
2. **Take Notes**: Write concepts in `notes/week-XX-topic.md`
3. **Understand**: Focus on definitions, theorems, formulas

**Practice Phase** (30-60 mins):
1. **Open Notebook**: `notebooks/week-XX-practice.ipynb`
2. **Implement**: Code the concepts from your notes
3. **Visualize**: Create plots to see concepts in action
4. **Experiment**: Try variations and explore

**Review** (10 mins):
- Update progress tracker
- Note questions or unclear concepts
- Plan tomorrow's topics

### Weekly Routine
- **Mon-Wed**: Lectures + Theory
  - Attend classes
  - Take **notes** (concepts, formulas, theory)
  - Read textbook chapters
- **Thu-Fri**: Practice + Implementation
  - Work through **notebooks** (code examples)
  - Solve computational problems
  - Create visualizations
- **Sat**: Assignments + Projects
  - Complete assignments
  - Work on mini-projects
  - Apply concepts to real problems
- **Sun**: Review + Integration
  - Review theory from **notes**
  - Run through code in **notebooks**
  - Connect theory to practice
  - Plan next week

## 📁 Quick Navigation

### Where to Put What?

| Content Type | Location | Format | Purpose |
|--------------|----------|--------|---------|
| **Theory & Concepts** | `[Subject]/notes/` | Markdown (.md) | Study content, definitions, formulas |
| **Code Examples** | `[Subject]/notebooks/` | Jupyter (.ipynb) | Implementations, visualizations |
| **Assignments** | `[Subject]/assignments/` | Various | Course work submissions |
| **Extra Problems** | `[Subject]/practice/` | Any format | Additional practice |
| **Resources** | `[Subject]/resources/` | PDFs, links | Reference materials |

### File Naming
```
✅ Good:
- week-01-introduction.md
- 2025-11-14-calculus.md
- 01-basics-practice.ipynb
- assignment-01-solution.py

❌ Avoid:
- notes.md (too generic)
- stuff.ipynb (not descriptive)
- final_final_v2.py (confusing)
```

## 💡 Pro Tips for Foundation Level

### Mathematics
- Use Python to verify calculations
- Visualize every function you learn
- Practice 5-10 problems daily

### Statistics  
- Always visualize your data first
- Learn theory AND implementation
- Use real datasets for practice

### Python
- Code every single day (even 30 mins)
- Type code, don't copy-paste
- Build small projects weekly

### General
- **Space repetition** works better than cramming
- **Teach others** to solidify understanding
- **Ask questions** early and often
- **Stay consistent** over being perfect
