# IIT Madras BS Data Science & Applications - Learning Repository

Welcome to my comprehensive learning workspace for the **IIT Madras BS in Data Science and Applications** program! This repository serves as my organized study system, designed to work seamlessly with AI assistants for consistent learning support.

## 🎓 About My Studies

I am currently enrolled in the [IIT Madras BS in Data Science and Applications](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/) program - a comprehensive 4-year online degree program covering:
- **Data Science Courses**: ML Foundations, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, LLMs, Big Data
- **Programming**: Python, Java, PostgreSQL, Linux, C Programming, Full Stack Development
- **Frameworks**: Flask, Vue, NumPy, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, OpenCV, Kafka
- **Business Analytics**: Business Data Management, Market Research, Managerial Economics

## 📚 Repository Purpose

This repository is **RAG-optimized** - designed to help AI assistants understand my learning context and maintain consistency when helping me study. The organized structure allows AI agents to:

1. **Retrieve** relevant course context and previous work
2. **Understand** my progress and learning patterns
3. **Generate** consistent, contextually-aware study materials
4. **Maintain** continuity across study sessions

Think of it as a "second brain" that AI assistants can read to provide better, more personalized learning support.

- ✅ Continuity in long-term learning projects

## 📖 Study Organization System

### Folder Structure
Each subject follows this consistent pattern:
- **`notes/`** - Study content, theory, concepts, formulas (Markdown)
- **`notebooks/`** - Examples, applications, hands-on practice (Jupyter)
- **`assignments/`** - Course assignments and solutions
- **`practice/`** - Additional practice problems
- **`projects/`** - Applied learning projects
- **`resources/`** - Reference materials and links

### Clear Separation: Notes vs Notebooks

#### 📝 Notes (Theory & Concepts)
**Purpose**: Study content and theoretical understanding  
**Format**: Markdown (.md)  
**Contains**:
- Lecture summaries and key concepts
- Definitions and theorems
- Formulas and equations
- Proofs and derivations
- Conceptual explanations
- Theory from textbooks/lectures

**Example**: `notes/week-01-set-theory.md`
```markdown
# Set Theory Basics

## Definitions
- Set: A collection of distinct objects
- Union: A ∪ B = {x | x ∈ A or x ∈ B}
- Intersection: A ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}

## Theorems
1. De Morgan's Laws: (A ∪ B)' = A' ∩ B'
...
```

#### 💻 Notebooks (Examples & Applications)
**Purpose**: Hands-on practice and implementation  
**Format**: Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)  
**Contains**:
- Code examples demonstrating concepts
- Worked solutions to problems
- Visualizations and plots
- Computational experiments
- Practice exercises with code
- Real-world applications

**Example**: `notebooks/week-01-set-operations.ipynb`
```python
# Implementing set operations in Python
A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

# Union
print(A | B)  # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

# Intersection
print(A & B)  # {4, 5}
```

### Note-Taking Format
I use a standardized Markdown template for all notes:
```markdown
# Topic Name
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Week**: X
**Subject**: [Subject Name]
**Tags**: #topic #important

## 💡 Learning Approach

### With AI Assistant Support
When working with AI assistants on this repository:
1. **Provide Context**: Share which subject/week you're working on
2. **Ask Specific Questions**: Reference exact files and topics
3. **Request Consistency**: Ask AI to follow repository templates
4. **Update Progress**: Keep COMPLETION-STATUS.md files current
5. **Review Regularly**: AI can help generate study summaries

### Study Best Practices
- **Daily Routine**: Review notes (10min) → Practice code (30-60min) → Update progress (5min)
- **Weekly Review**: Consolidate learning, complete assignments, plan next week
- **Monthly Assessment**: Review all subjects, identify weak areas, adjust strategy
- **Consistency Over Intensity**: 2 hours daily beats 14 hours on weekend
