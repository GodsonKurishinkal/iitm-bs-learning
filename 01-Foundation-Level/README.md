## 📁 Folder Organization

Each subject follows this structure with **clear separation**:

```
Subject/
├── notes/           # 📝 Study content: theory, concepts, formulas (Markdown)
│   └── week-01-topic.md
│
├── notebooks/       # 💻 Practice: examples, applications, code (Jupyter)
│   └── week-01-practice.ipynb
│
├── assignments/     # Course assignments and solutions
├── practice/        # Additional practice problems
├── projects/        # Mini-projects (where applicable)
└── resources/       # Reference materials, links, cheatsheets
```

### 📝 Notes vs 💻 Notebooks

**Notes** (`notes/` folder):
- **Content**: Theory, concepts, definitions, theorems, formulas
- **Format**: Markdown (.md)
- **Purpose**: Study and understand concepts
- **When**: During/after lectures, while reading textbooks
- **Example**: Mathematical proofs, statistical theorems, algorithm explanations

**Notebooks** (`notebooks/` folder):
- **Content**: Code examples, implementations, visualizations, applications
- **Format**: Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
- **Purpose**: Practice and apply concepts through coding
- **When**: After understanding theory from notes
- **Example**: Implementing algorithms, plotting functions, solving computational problems

## 📝 Note-Taking Tips

### For Notes (Theory)
1. **Use Markdown** for text notes in the `notes/` folder
2. **Capture concepts** - definitions, theorems, formulas
3. **Write explanations** in your own words
4. **Include derivations** and proofs step-by-step
5. **Date your notes** - Format: `week-XX-topic.md` or `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`
6. **Tag your notes** - Add tags like `#week1`, `#important`, `#exam`

### For Notebooks (Practice)
1. **Start with concepts** from your notes
2. **Implement in code** - translate theory to Python
3. **Visualize** - create plots and graphs
4. **Experiment** - try variations and edge cases
5. **Document** - add markdown cells explaining what you're doing
6. **Save outputs** before closing to track your progress

## 💻 Study Workflow

### Step 1: Learn Theory (Notes)
```
Read textbook/watch lecture
    ↓
Take notes in notes/week-XX-topic.md
    ↓
Understand concepts, formulas, theorems
```

### Step 2: Apply Through Code (Notebooks)
```
Open notebooks/week-XX-practice.ipynb
    ↓
Implement concepts from notes
    ↓
Create visualizations and examples
    ↓
Solve practice problems
```

### Step 3: Reinforce (Practice)
```
Complete assignments/
Solve additional problems in practice/
Build mini-projects in projects/
```

## 🎯 Study Strategy

### Weekly Routine
- **Monday-Friday**: Attend lectures, take notes
- **Weekend**: Practice with Jupyter notebooks
- **Sunday**: Review week's material, solve practice problems

### Before Exams
1. Review all notes in `notes/` folder
2. Redo practice problems in `practice/` folder
3. Complete sample problems from `assignments/`
4. Create summary sheets in `resources/`

## 📊 Progress Tracking

Create a `progress.md` file in each subject folder to track:
- [ ] Topics completed
- [ ] Assignments submitted
- [ ] Practice problems solved
- [ ] Weak areas to review
