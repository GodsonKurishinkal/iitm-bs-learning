## 📁 Folder Organization

Each subject follows this structure:

```
Subject/
├── notes/           # Study notes (Markdown, PDFs)
├── notebooks/       # Jupyter notebooks for practice
├── assignments/     # Course assignments and solutions
├── practice/        # Additional practice problems
├── projects/        # Mini-projects (where applicable)
└── resources/       # Reference materials, links, cheatsheets
```

## 📝 Note-Taking Tips

1. **Use Markdown** for text notes in the `notes/` folder
2. **Use Jupyter Notebooks** for code and computational practice
3. **Date your notes** - Use format: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic-name.md`
4. **Tag your notes** - Add tags like `#week1`, `#important`, `#exam`
5. **Review regularly** - Revisit notes weekly

## 💻 Jupyter Notebook Workflow

1. **Start with template notebooks** in each subject's `notebooks/` folder
2. **Create weekly practice notebooks**: `week-01-practice.ipynb`
3. **Document your learning** in the notes section at the end
4. **Save outputs** before closing to track your progress

## 🎯 Study Strategy

### Weekly Routine
- **Monday-Friday**: Attend lectures, take notes
- **Weekend**: Practice with Jupyter notebooks
- **Sunday**: Review week's material, solve practice problems

### Before Exams
1. Review all notes in `notes/` folder
2. Redo practice problems in `practice/` folder
3. Complete sample problems from `assignments/`
4. Create summary sheets in `resources/`

## 📊 Progress Tracking

Create a `progress.md` file in each subject folder to track:
- [ ] Topics completed
- [ ] Assignments submitted
- [ ] Practice problems solved
- [ ] Weak areas to review
