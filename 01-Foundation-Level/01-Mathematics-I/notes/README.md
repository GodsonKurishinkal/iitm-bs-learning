## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

1. **Sets & Relations**
   - Define and manipulate sets using operations (union, intersection, difference)
   - Understand relations and their properties (reflexive, symmetric, transitive)
   - Work with functions as special relations

2. **Coordinate Geometry**
   - Plot and analyze points in 2D and 3D coordinate systems
   - Work with equations of lines, circles, and other geometric shapes
   - Apply transformations (translation, rotation, scaling)

3. **Functions**
   - Understand different types of functions (linear, quadratic, polynomial)
   - Analyze function properties (domain, range, injective, surjective)
   - Graph and transform functions

4. **Graph Theory**
   - Represent real-world problems using graphs
   - Analyze graph properties (connectivity, paths, cycles)
   - Work with trees and their applications in data science

## ✅ Study Tips

1. **Follow Sequential Order:** Math builds on previous concepts - don't skip weeks
2. **Work Through Examples:** Type out all Python code examples, don't just read
3. **Practice Problems:** Do at least 5-10 problems per week
4. **Visual Learning:** Draw graphs, Venn diagrams, coordinate systems
5. **Connect to Data Science:** Ask "How is this used in ML/AI?"
6. **Review Regularly:** Revisit previous topics every 2-3 weeks
7. **Join Study Groups:** Discuss problems with peers
8. **Use Jupyter Notebooks:** Interactive coding helps understanding
